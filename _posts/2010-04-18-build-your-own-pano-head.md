I have been [taking panoramas for a long](https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/100316409139267860520/photos/) time always hand-holding the camera, I quickly noticed how hard it is to do this in a small ambient. To avoid strong parallax errors the only solution is using a [panoramic head](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panoramic_head). There are many professional (as much professional as expensive) pano-heads out there, you can check [this list](http://wiki.panotools.org/Heads). I decided to build my own mainly for these reasons:

1.  it's much much cheaper
2.  it's smaller and lighter
3.  it's custom, sized for my camera and lens, it won't need any further configuration
In fact with such a small rotator (the tube itself), the nadir shot (the one downward) will be much better and clearer than with the other pano-heads.
There are of course also cons, as a lower precision and.. stop! Following are different pictures that should explain how I did. I did not write a complete tutorial since the materials and the techniques highly depend on want you can get at your local store :D. By the way the hardest part was fixing the screw inside the aluminum tube, that has been achieved by putting the screw inside a wider screw (cold have been plastic or cork) and fixing it all with a pin. Remember to [find the nodal point of your lens](http://teocomi.com/detect-the-nodal-point-of-your-lens-how-to/) before starting building it! 


Inspiration has been taken from these very good examples of homemade panoramic heads:
