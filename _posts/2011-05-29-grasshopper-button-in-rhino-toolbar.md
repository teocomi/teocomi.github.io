Here's how to do that:

1.  Download [my custom grasshopper toolbar](/assets/d/grasshopper.tb)
2.  Put it into the folder *C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application data\McNeel\Rhinoceros\4.0\* for Windows XP and *C:\ProgramData\McNeel\Rhinoceros\4.0\* for Windows Vista/Seven.
3.  From Rhino, *Tools > Toolbar Layout... > File > Open... > Select: grasshopper.tp*
4.  Make sure the label *Grasshopper* is checked
5.  You're done, now close the window and just drag the toolbar where you prefer!
