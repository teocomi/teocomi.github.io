My friend and coworker Michael has just published the third article of a great series about Issue Tracking for the AEC.
Funny enough, weeks ago someone claimed [BIMcollab](http://www.bimcollab.com/en/default.aspx) to be the [fist issue tracking system for BIM](http://bimoutsourcing.com/bimcollab-is-the-first-ever-issue-tracking-sytem-for-bim-projects.html). Well, that's not exactly true...

You should really check out the following articles from his blog [collectiveBIM](http://collectivebim.com/):

1.  [The Future of Issue Tracking for the AEC. Will it be AEC software?](http://collectivebim.com/future-issue-tracking-aec/)
2.  [The Future of Issue Tracking for the AEC. Will BCF be a solution?](http://collectivebim.com/future-issue-tracking-bcf/)
3.  [The Future of Issue Tracking for the AEC â€“ How CASE Continues to Craft It](http://collectivebim.com/future-issue-tracking-aec-case-jira-solibri-bcf/)
